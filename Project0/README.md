Here is an example project readme file.  You should modify this for your project and do this for every project over the term.  This project contains the analysis and report files for project 0 for the Bios 6623 class.  
Data are kept out of this directory.  If you are interested in working on the project and
do not have the data, please write nichole.carlson@ucdenver.edu and I can provide a copy
of this dataset.  It is a teaching dataset from historical data.

The general info on this project is: 1) SAS and R analysis and data management files can be 
found in the Code folder; 2) Reports contain the graphs and figures from my code and the
reports that were created along the way; 3) Docs contains graphs and figures at times and
other things like investigator questions or docs the investigator sent me.

The description of the project is:
Dental researchers were interested in a new gel treatment for gum disease.  In their study, 
subjects were randomly assigned to one of 5 treatments: no treatment and four levels of an active 
substance in a gel. The lowest level was a placebo (=1) and then another control group (=2), like 
the "no treatment" group. The remaining three levels were low(=3), medium(=4), and high(=5) 
concentrations of the active ingredient in the gel.  The patients were recruited via a single 
midwestern dental research clinic.  There were 130 participants.  Participants were asked to 
rub the gel on their gums twice daily.  The measurements being followed over time were whole-mouth 
average pocket depth and whole mouth average attachment loss. Visits were at baseline and 1 year. 
Pocket depth and attachment loss were measured at many sites within each participant's mouth and 
then averaged (at each visit).  The variable called “sites” gives the number of sites used in the 
averages.  Pocket depth and attachment loss are both measures of how far the gums have pulled away 
from the teeth, hence smaller values are better.  Whole-mouth average is used because the measurements 
within mouth are highly correlated in a complicated way, which is not yet fully understood by dental researchers.
Additional demographic information was collected on race(5=white,4=Asian,2=African American,1=Native American), 
gender(1=male,2=female), age, and smoking status (yes=1/no=0).  Site is the number of sites measured 
to get the average outcome measurement.  Missing values are denoted by an “NA”.  

**The primary question of interest is whether treatment results in lower average 
pocket depth and attachment loss at one year.**
